# Less Annoying CRM API Documentation - Other Tips

## Overview
This page documents best practices and important concepts for working with the Less Annoying CRM API, specifically focusing on field editing, contact/company relationships, and webhooks.

## Editing Only Certain Fields

When using edit functions like `EditContact` or `EditTask`, developers have flexibility in what they modify:

### Selective Updates
- Only include fields you want to change
- Omitted fields remain unchanged

### Critical Distinction
There's a meaningful difference between excluding a field versus passing `null`:
- **Omitted field** = preserve existing value
- **`null` value** = clear/blank the field

### Implication
The API respects granular control, allowing updates without affecting unmodified data.

## Contacts and Companies

The system manages contact-company relationships through the company name field.

### Creation Logic for New Contacts

1. If a company with the specified name exists, the contact links to that company
2. If no matching company exists, the system creates one automatically
3. Duplicate company names are prevented in the CRM

### Permission-Based Isolation
These linking rules apply only within user permission boundaries. Multiple users can independently create companies with identical names if they lack visibility into each other's data.

## Webhooks

Webhooks enable proactive notifications when users perform actions within the application.

### Key Features
- Real-time notifications
- Event-driven architecture
- Customizable triggers

### More Information
Detailed webhook documentation is available in the Advanced section under "Using webhooks."
