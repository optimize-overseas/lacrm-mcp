# Less Annoying CRM API Documentation - Webhooks (Settings Functions)

## Overview
The Webhooks API allows developers to configure automated POST requests to specified URLs triggered by user actions within the CRM system. When you set up a webhook, LACRM will send a POST to a URL you specify, triggered by specific user actions in the CRM.
