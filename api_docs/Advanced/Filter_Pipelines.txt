# Less Annoying CRM API Documentation - Advanced Search Filters (Pipelines)

## Overview
The Less Annoying CRM API supports advanced filtering for pipeline items through the `GetPipelineItems` function. Filters enable narrowing results based on specific criteria.

---

## Filter Structure

Each filter object contains three components:

1. **Name** - The field to filter on
2. **Operation** - The type of comparison to perform
3. **Value** - The criteria to match against

---

## Key Principle

"Because fields can be customized, the available filters are different on every account."

This means filter availability varies by CRM instance. Users must authenticate to view filters specific to their account configuration.

---

## Accessing Pipeline-Specific Filters

Filters are organized by pipeline type. Users can select a specific pipeline (such as "Lead") to see applicable filter options for that pipeline's items.

---

## Common Filter Operations

Based on the data types documentation, common operations include:

### Text Fields
- `Contains`
- `DoesNotContain`
- `IsExactly`
- `IsNot`
- `IsEmpty`
- `IsNotEmpty`

### Date Fields
- `IsExactly`
- `IsBetween`
- `IsBefore`
- `IsAfter`
- `IsEmpty`
- `IsNotEmpty`

### Number Fields
- `IsExactly`
- `IsGreaterThan`
- `IsLessThan`
- `IsBetween`

### Dropdown/Enum Fields
- `IsExactly`
- `IsNot`
- `IsAnyOf`
- `IsNoneOf`

## Data Type Considerations

Filter value types follow the system's broader data type framework:
- **Uid**: Unique identifiers (store as strings)
- **Text**: String values
- **Date**: Format `yyyy-mm-dd`
- **DateTime**: ISO 8601 format
- **Number**: Integer values
- **Bool**: true/false

## Related Function

Filters are specifically used with the `GetPipelineItems` endpoint:

```json
{
  "Function": "GetPipelineItems",
  "Parameters": {
    "PipelineId": "your-pipeline-id",
    "AdvancedFilters": [
      {
        "Name": "StatusId",
        "Operation": "IsExactly",
        "Value": "status-uid"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Important Note
The actual filter names and operations available depend on your specific account configuration and custom fields. Log in to the documentation portal to see your account-specific filters.
